        <h2> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>

        <p class="speech speech-1"> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
          make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p class="speech speech-2"> “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a
          mobile engineer
          for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

        <h2> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
          learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>

        <p class="speech speech-4"> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
          refreshing. The program
          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
          an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ” </p>

      <h2> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </h2>

      <p class="speech speech-5">
        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! ”</p>
